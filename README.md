Django REST API project for learning purposes.

## Steps

### Creation of Virtual Environment

Enter the following commands on a console placed in your project folder (using VSC console directly in my case):

```console
pip install virtualenv
py -m virtualenv venv
```

### Using the Virtual Environment

One option is to enter the following command:

`.\venv\Scripts\activate`

But for convenience, best option is to select the specific Python interpreter for out virtual environment. We can select it, on VSC, pressing "F1" and searching for "Python select interpreter". The adequate Python interpreter should be higlighted as the recommended one.
